			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<p>My hobby is playing video games on PC and one of the most popular ways to get games on that platform is to use Steam. Steam is a digital distribution marketplace for PC games.
				It provides gamers with a vast library of new and old games that can be downloaded at varying price points. This is a great way for people like me with limited time and budget 
				to get access to games because there are many independently made games that cost little and are not vastly time consuming, and they often have sales that drop game prices to as low as 90% off.
				The vast library also can cause problems though. With such a large selection, it is hard to decide what games to buy and its hard to always notice when a game you want is on sale. My app is
				a suite of tools to help the steam gamer organize and make decisions about what games to buy. </p>
