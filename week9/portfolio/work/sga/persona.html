			<h2>Persona</h2>
			<img  id="tom"  src="images/tom.jpg" width="130" height="195" />
			<p> Tom is a 22 year old mechanical engineering student at Saginaw Valley State University. He has a part time job in a furniture shop that helps pay for what student loans don't and it 
				gives him some spending money as well. He has close friends but he cant always see them in person due to his busy schedule. One of his favorite ways to stay in touch with his friends
				is to play video games with his friends on PC and talk to them on Skype. He is a fan of cooperative games, shooters and RPGs, and uses Steam to purchase many of his games because of the 
				convenience and low prices. Aside from socializing Tom also enjoys video games because they help him unwind and relax after a busy day of studying or work. Tom is a neat person 
				that likes to have things organized and despite being a PC gamer is not extremely tech savvy. </p>
